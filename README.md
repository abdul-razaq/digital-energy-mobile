## Project Implementation and Features
This project renders a list of products from the API endpoint provided using React Query and Axios. It renders each product on the home screen as an individual card which contains all the details of each product.

I used FlatList to render the products for performance and also added "pull to referesh" feature so that the list can be pulled to refetch the products.

I added proper error handling which displays an error page when an error occurs and contains a button that allows you refetch the products.

I used dummy images from pexels.com to represent each product type and used nativewind css to style my components.

I loaded and used the Satoshi Font for the texts and used a custom hook to load the application fonts.

I created a function that is responsible for fetching the products and contains extensive error handling.

I also used Typescript for typechecking and to create interfaces for the objects I'm getting back from the API.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you need further details about my code and instruction in running and understanding my code properly.

Thank you.
